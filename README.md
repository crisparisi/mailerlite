# MailerLite Assignment

This is a landing page that entices visitors to sign up for email from MailerLite. 

MailerLite publishes weekly newsletters as their main marketing channel. They send it to more than 200,000 subscribers and the number is growing each week. Some of their subscribers are already paying customers, others are on free plan or are just interested in MailerLite.

Newsletter topics that are covered include: MailerLite features and updates, email marketing, business, remote, team and etc.

This page showcases the benefits of signing up for these email newsletters and also offers a small incentive (free sticker). Some of the product features are also highlighted offering information about the various capabilites of MailerLite.

Some thoughts behind the layout:

- The overall MailerLite branding was retained for continuity and familiarty for returning/current users
- The top portion gives a brief explantion of the purpose of the page and immediately presents the option to jump straight into signing up
- The main header image showcases some fo the items you may expect to see in an email newsletter
- The incentive setion offers a more fun, interactive visual that also should help curious users take the next step in signing up
- The remaining sections outline some product features and then focus on what makes MailerLite stand out in the market, such as fair pricing, a great team of people behind the product, testimonials and reliable support
- The page also offers a couple quick options to gain some valuable information and answer two common questions htat may be on the minds of prospective users.

Overall, the focus is still on the product and what it offers in a space where competitors offer overly complex platforms that move further away from the focus on the customer. It's important to offer both current customers and prospects a broad look at the product while also encouraging the action the sign up to gain valuable insight by receiving the newsletters.
