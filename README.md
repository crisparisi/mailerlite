# MailerLite Assignment

This project showcases a landing page that entices visitors to sign up for email from MailerLite. 

MailerLite publishes weekly newsletters as their main marketing channel. They send it to more than 200,000 subscribers and the number is growing each week. Some of their subscribers are already paying customers, others are on their free plan or are just interested in MailerLite.

Newsletter topics that are covered include: MailerLite features and updates, email marketing, business, remote, team, etc.

This page showcases the benefits of signing up for these email newsletters while also offering a small incentive (free sticker). Some of the product features are also highlighted offering information about the various capabilites of MailerLite.

Some thoughts behind the layout:

- The overall MailerLite branding was retained for continuity and familiarity for returning/current users
- The top portion gives a brief explantion of the purpose of the page and immediately presents the option to jump straight into signing up
- The main header image showcases some of the items you may expect to see in an email newsletter
- The incentive section offers a more fun, interactive visual that should help convince curious users to take the next step in signing up
- The remaining sections outline product features and shifts focus to what makes MailerLite stand out in the market, such as fair pricing, a great team of people behind the product and reliable support
- The page also offers quick options to gain valuable information (via testimonials) and addresses two common questions that may be important to prospective users

The focus of the page is on the product and what it offers email marketers and small business owners. It is important to offer both current customers and prospects a broad look at the product while also encouraging the action to sign up to gain valuable insight by receiving the newsletters.
